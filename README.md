### Implementations of some Classic ML and Deep Learning Algorithms
NN_from_scratch.ipynb - Implementation of **Vanilla DNN** using _Numpy_.

NN_with_Auto_Grad.ipynb - Implementaiton of **Vanilla DNN** with Adam optimizer using _TensorFlow Autograd_.

RNN_from_scratch.ipynb - Implemenation of **Recurrent Neural Network** using _Numpy_. As an addition the model is trying to predict next character(generating symbol-level text generation) using the 
Winnie-the-Pooh Book by A. A. Milne as a training data.
